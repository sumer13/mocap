Since Tensorflow is under very active development and undergoes frequent "changes" this is an abstraction layer so that all the tensorflow crazyness is handled transparently.
In the end what we need is to just give a vector of numbers run the network and get back a vector of numbers.
We don't care about all the internals of tensorflow
